      descriprion : " This is a React web project that fetches live sports scores from a REST API using Axios.The API endpoint used in this project is the sportscore1 API, which requires an X-RapidAPI-Key and X-RapidAPI-Host header to be included in the GET request.The scores are fetched using the useEffect hook and are stored in a state variable called scores.The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from the API, and includes a loop that requests data from the API. The fetched data is then added to the currentScores array and stored in the scores state variable using the setScores method.The fetched scores are displayed on the webpage in a formatted layout using the map() function, which loops through the scores array and creates a div for each score. The scores are displayed with the home and away team logos,and the current score is displayed in the center of the div.Overall, this web project provides an interactive way to keep up with live sports scores and is a great example of how to use React and Axios to fetch and display data from a REST API.",
